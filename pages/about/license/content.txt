<p>You could use Fine Cut engine with both, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" target="_blank">MIT</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="_blank">GPL</a> license.</p>
<br />

<p>Here is some copy-paste from jQuery license notes for you to easy read what does it mean in couple of short prases:</p><br />
<em>
<p>The MIT License is recommended for most projects.<br />
It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a Fine Cut Engine.</p>
<p>If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use under that license.</p>
<p>You don’t have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don’t have to notify anyone which license you are using.<br />
You are free to use a Fine Cut Engine in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.</p>
<br />
