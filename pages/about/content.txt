<p>Except of some core features Fine Cut engine completely built by using blocks of code, made by somebody else.</p>
<p>This point we wish to introduce that free web keeps better each day.</p>
<br />

<p>And, as for us, this was main example how free people could help each other.</p>
<br />

<p>Building Fine Cut was experiment, 5 day experiment.</p>
<p>Most parts of its own code was made this 5 days.</p>
<p>And, however, there was a lot of changes after, but, we could say &mdash; Finecut was built in 5 days.</p>
<p>So, we are proud to live in such a wonderfull time when technologies are fast and thinking is relevant.</p>
