<em>For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.<br />
Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. <br />
We learned to talk and we learned to listen. ... <br />
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.</em><br />

<p>Except of some core features Fine Cut engine completely built by using blocks of code, made by somebody else.</p>
<p>This points that free web becomes better each day.</p>
<p>And, it is a good example of how free-mind people could help each other.</p>
<p>Building of Fine Cut Engine was an experiment, personal 5 days experiment, when started and finished coding. But, one could never reach without all these parts, prepeared by other people and teams before. </p>

<p>And, however, there was a lot of changes done after, to bring more stability, compatibility, profomance and simplicity, anyway, still:<br />
 &laquo;Fine Cut is built in 5 days&raquo;.</p>
<p>So, friend, be proud to live in such a wonderfull time when technologies are fast and thinking is relevant.</p>
