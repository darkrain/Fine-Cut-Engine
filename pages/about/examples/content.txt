<p><em>Just keep in mind: there is another way.</em></p><br />

<p><strong>Imagine: for about 90% websites don't even need any DB.</strong>
<br /></p>
<p>We hope, people who made this sites, just never thought about this.</p>

<p>All these sites made for the only mission &ndash; to tell about something or someone.</p>
<p>Yes, they have a lot of dynamic content, like: news, photos, product line data and so on... Dynamic... yepp...</p>
<p>But, please, ask Youself, how much of this content is entirely necessary to be in such a dynamic way?</p>
<br>
<p>Please. We all are well remembered about personal pages or organization promo sites with almost static news, ads, rss, product lines, etc.</p>
<p>So, do we really need News management in DB?</p>
<p>Or do we really need Photo Album with odd storage and extremely hard usability?</p>
<p>Or do we really need goods promo with diversed structure, but which is not such as well sell as complicated?</p>
<br>

<p>So, we are going to tell some advices below, when building sites with Fine Cut:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thing could be done with just non standard way of thinking...</li>
<li><p>For example, if You need that &laquo;news&raquo; page.<br />
You could make it with at least three ways:</p>
<ol>

<li>

<p>First of all, You could create template, which uses &laquo;Blocks code of Page.&raquo;</p>

<p><a href="/files/images/pm_blocks.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank">
<img border="0" src="/files/tumbs/pm_blocks.png" alt="Pages Manager : block parts" width="132" height="89"></a><br /></p>

<p>So, if You will use page blocks for storing data, You'll easy find this blocks data collection inside of template.</p>
<p>Then, You could make such as much news pages as You need: weekly page, monthly page, yearly page.</p>
<p>Just with using directory based structure</p>
<pre> /pages/news/YYYY/MM/DD/Number </pre>
<p>You could simply bring all this to &laquo;dynamics&raquo; vision with just links and landings.</p>
<br />
<p>Here somebody &laquo;professional&raquo; could ask: <br />
"And what if i wish to change something?"</p>
<p>The answer is simple: &laquo;When&raquo;?</p><br />

</li>

<li>

<p>At second, You could create template, which uses Properties code of Page.</p>

<p><a href="/files/images/pm_props.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank"></p>
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_props.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Properties JSON  Editor" width = "132" height = "89"></a></p>

<p>Yes, with the same result.</p>
<br />

</li>

<li>
<p>OR, finally, for our advanced folks: you could <a href="/documentation/advanced/integration/">integrate</a> Fine Cut with Your favorite PHP framework and use DB for storing data.</p>
<p>It integrates very well because there is no engine in template at all, just pure PHP, You could it use as You wish.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>


<li>Or, may be You need documentation with hierarchical structure?<br />
We have draft component that generates left side menu for it.<br />
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
<p>And exactly this page is example that Fine Cut Engine was built very &laquo;Agile&raquo;: </p>
<p>If You'll &laquo;install&raquo; Fine Cut and look inside Admin Panel,<br />
You'll find this page was built with another template and another components inside.<br />
The left menu component, if You don't mind.<br />
