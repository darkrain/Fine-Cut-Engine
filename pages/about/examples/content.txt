<h3>Just keep in mind that there is another way.</h3><br />

<p>And, we are going to tell some advices below, when building sites with Fine Cut:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thing could be made with just non standard way of thinking...</li>
<li><p>For example, if You need news page.<br />
You could make it with at least three ways:</p>
<ol>

<li>

<p>First of all, You could create template, which uses Blocks code of Page.</p>

<p><a href="/files/images/pm_blocks.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank">
<img border="0" src="/files/tumbs/pm_blocks.png" alt="Pages Manager : block parts" width="132" height="89"></a><br /></p>

<p>So, if You will use page blocks for storing data, You'll easy find data iside of template.</p>
<br />
<p>Then, You could make as much news pages as You need: weekly page, monthly page, yearly page.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>At second, You could create template, which uses Properties code of Page.</p>

<p><a href="/files/images/pm_props.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank"></p>
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_props.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Properties JSON  Editor" width = "132" height = "89"></a></p>

<p>Yes, with the same result.</p>
<br />

</li>

<li>
<p>OR You could <a href="/documentation/advanced/integration/">integrate</a> Fine Cut with Your favorite PHP framework and use DB for storing data.</p>
<p>It integrates very well because there is no engine in template at all, just pure PHP, You could use as You wish.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>


<li>Or, may be You need documentation with hierarchical structure?<br />
We have draft component that generates left side menu for it.<br />
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />
<p>And exactly this page is example that Fine Cut Engine was built very &laquo;Agile&raquo;: </p>
<p>If You'll install Fine Cut and look inside Admin Panel.<br />
You'll find this page was built with another template and another components inside.<br />
The left menu component, if You don't mind.</p>
