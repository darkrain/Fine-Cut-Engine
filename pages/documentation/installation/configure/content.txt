<p>Usually everything goes well after installation.</p>
<p>But, sometimes you'll need to make preferences for Fine Cut Engine.</p>
<br />
<p>So, here are things that could be configured directly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path to folder where site contents will be stored.</li>
<li>To use cache or not, default is &laquo;to use&raquo;.</li>
<li>Path to folder where cache will be stored.</li>
<li>Permission for files and folders creation.</li>
<li>File name encoding inside of webserver, default is UTF-8.</li>
<li>To use microtime echo while responding pages or not, default is &laquo;to use&raquo;.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>This settings could be found inside of &laquo;_adm&raquo; paned at &laquo;Settings&raquo; tab.</p>
<p>There you could also find buttons to save re-configured settings, to clean cache, and checkboxes used to work with admin panel.</p>
<p>
<a href="/files/images/settings.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/settings.png" alt="Settings" width = "132" height = "89"></a>
</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>Last thing we wish to say about setting is that you could move Admin panell to other path.<br />
At first you'll need to rename &laquo;<strong>_adm</strong>&raquo; <br />
inside of &laquo;<strong>_engine\index.php</strong>&raquo; code.
This &laquo;key string&raquo; is at line 3 there.<br />
Then you should simply rename folder.<br />
All this could be done inside Admin panel.
After doing this go to panel new path <strong>immediately</strong>, because all browser scripts right now are looking to wrong folder.
