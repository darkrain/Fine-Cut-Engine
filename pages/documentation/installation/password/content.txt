<p>By default Fine Cut Admin Panel have no protection...</p>
<p>And there is no user management, because we suppose Fine Cut will be mostly used by one person who creates small website.</p>
<br />
<p>Then, we prefere to use Apache Authentification to protect our Admin Panel.</p>
<p>You could find that last four lines of &laquo; _adm/.htacces &raquo; are commented:</p>
<br />

<pre>
#AuthType basic
#AuthName "auth requred"
#AuthUserFile /home/www/your_site_directory/.htpasswd
#Require valid-user
</pre>
<br />

<p>So, you need to create your own &laquo;.htpasswd&raquo; file throug &laquo;htpasswd&raquo; utility.</p>
<br />

<p>Use your favorite search engine to find more information about &laquo;htpasswd&raquo;.</p>
