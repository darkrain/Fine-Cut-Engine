<p>We use this page to create a collection of page's necessary data structure in one level array structure.</p>
<p>It could be used to store, for example, news line or something else, not very long, but each like to another.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Please, remember that here is strange behaviour.</strong></p>
<p>When you will write something inside of a block, <strong>DO NOT SAVE PAGE IMMEDIATELY!</strong></p>
<p>At first you need to <strong>STEP OUT</strong> of written block, because otherwise data will not be remembered inside of the blocks model.</p>
