As you see, here is almost nothing to complicate about.
</p>
<p>Two only things we need to tell are: &laquo;<strong>that checkbox</strong>&raquo; and &laquo;<strong>Head Additional</strong>&raquo; textarea.</p>

<p>&mdash; &laquo;<strong>checkbox</strong>&raquo; means that engine will never make static cache for page, page will be always generated from source. So, if You need dynamic content with included [Your Favorite PHP Engine], then &ndash;  use this checkbox preposition first.</p>

<p>&mdash; we use &laquo;<strong>Head Additional</strong>&raquo; textarea to store code of additional page components, such as CSS or JavaScript in situation when we don't need this code inside of template.<br />
For example, you have a template, where is a lot of libs are already used. <br />
Then, may be You'll get situation where you need to add a couple of libs for one page. But this libs are big, and, actually You don't wish to add them inside of the template. Here we've got situation of this textarea proposal. </p>
<p>We are using this textarea to add links to LightBox CSS and JS libs on pages where we need to place screenshots with lightbox browsing.</p>
<p>Yes, there is another way, to create new template. But for What? You always need to remember that this libs are included in another template, which exactly the same as your default one, except a couple of lines. And when you'll change something in &laquo;default&raquo;, you'll need to not forget to bring this changes to template with screenshots, cause it is almost the same. So, to not be in such a complex way here is a solution. </p>
