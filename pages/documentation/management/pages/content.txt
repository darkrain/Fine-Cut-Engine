<p>As you could see in following screenshot:</p>
<p>
<a href = "/files/images/pm_editor.png" target = "_blank">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/images/pm_editor.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Editor" width = "660" border = "0">
</a>
</p>

<p>there is a Tree Structure at the left side of [Pages Manager][Page Editor] tab.</p><br />

<p>Explanation of this tree is in that this is URLs or Paths inside of Fine Cut website: when somebody will browse it, words, used as names for tree leafs, are exact url paths with preservation of hierarchy.</p>

<p>So, on the first level of that tree are: &laquo;about&raquo;, &laquo;documentation&raquo; ... &laquo;_index&raquo;.</p>
<p>Then, when somebody will browse site, he will find an &laquo;<strong>about</strong>&raquo; page with path:<br />
<br />
<nobr>http://YourWebSite.url/YourFineCutDir/<strong>about</strong></nobr></p>
<br />

<p>And inside of &laquo;about&raquo; there was &laquo;<strong>forkus</strong>&raquo; and &laquo;<strong>screenshots</strong>&raquo;, therefore these pages will be availiable through:<br />
<br />
<nobr>http://YourWebSite.url/YourFineCutDir/<strong>about/forkus</strong></nobr><br />
<nobr>http://YourWebSite.url/YourFineCutDir/<strong>about/screenshots</strong></nobr></p>
<br />

<p><em>And here we need to note, that if you will create folder with name &laquo;<strong>about</strong>&raquo; directly inside of Fine Cut intsallation dir, you wouldn't be able to get page with name &laquo;<strong>about</strong>&raquo; from Fine Cut itself, because of real URL for this page will exist in this situation. Therefore URL planning is a very important thing, you need to think of.</em></p>

<p>Last, but <strong>very important agreement</strong> about URLs is in that <strong>root index page</strong> is named as <strong>&laquo;_index&raquo;</strong> at the first level of that tree. However, if you need, you could change this through code of &laquo;_engine/index.php&raquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Then, how do Fine Cut store pages, or &laquo;leafs&raquo;</p>
<p>This moment each page generated from four files: <br />

<p>&mdash; 
<a href="/files/images/pm_editor.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank" class = "scrImage">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_editor.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Editor" width = "33" ></a>
&laquo;page primary <a href="/documentation/management/pages/content/">content</a>&raquo;,
</p>

<p>&mdash; 
<a href="/files/images/pm_settings.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank" class = "scrImage">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_settings.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Settings" width = "33" ></a>
&laquo;<a href="/documentation/management/pages/header/">header</a> data and settings&raquo;,
</p>

<p>&mdash; 
<a href="/files/images/pm_props.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank" class = "scrImage">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_props.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Properties" width = "33" ></a>
&laquo;page additional <a href="/documentation/management/pages/properties/">properties</a>&raquo;,
</p>

<p>&mdash;
<a href="/files/images/pm_blocks.png" rel="lightbox[screenshost]" target="_blank" class = "scrImage">
<img border = "0"  src="/files/tumbs/pm_blocks.png" alt="Pages Manager : Page Blocks" width = "33" ></a>
&laquo;page <a href="/documentation/management/pages/blocks/">blocks</a>&raquo;
</p>

<p>You could reach exact File System Structure Path to stored page through:
<pre>
/ YourFineCutInstallationDir / <a href="/documentation/installation/configure/" target = "_blank">[$pages=]</a> / PagePathInTheTree
