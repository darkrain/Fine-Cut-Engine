<p>First of all &ndash; what does it mean &laquo;Fine Cut&raquo;?<br /></p>
<p>We got rid of everything we've found unnecessary to develop simple website.</p>
<p>John Lennon sang: &laquo;All You Need is Love&raquo;.<br />
We say: &laquo;all we need is UI&raquo;.</p>

<p>Then, for complete understanding Fine Cut, it is not enough to read this documentation.</p>
<br />
<p>However, we suppose, that there will be a lot of people, who don't ever need complete understanding.</p>
<br />
<p>But, if you wish, you need to investigate only one file: &laquo;_engine/index.php&raquo;</p>

<p>Somebody will tell: "Are You Serious?"</p>
<br />
<strong>OK, here is small FAQ:</strong><br /><br />

<li><strong>What are pages if there is no DB?</strong><br />
PHP file of Page and TXT files of its Properties.<br />
If You need anything else -- Use Your Favorite Framework!
<br />
<br />
</li>

<li><strong>What with other content? I need e-mail, rss, geoIP, maps, web-services...</strong>
<p>As for web-services, any page could be marked as <strong>&laquo;non cacheable&raquo;</strong><br />
 at Pages Manager => Settings tab.</p><br />

<p>As for the rest &ndash; write your own code.<br />
Please, lookup for <a href="/about/examples/">examples page</a>, if not yet.</p><br />

</li>

<li><strong>You told about perfomance, did you?</strong>
<p>I could tell that on my nettop with  AMD C-60 CPU inside, exactly this page generation process passthrough in ~0.05 sec. And while that generation, page stores in static. Therefore, when i will request page again, i will get it after ~0.007 sec. I use standard HDD 5400 rpm, and didn't any software optimisatoins.</p>
