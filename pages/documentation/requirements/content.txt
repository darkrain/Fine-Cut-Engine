<p>First of all, we suppose you'll use computers to work with Fine Cut Engine, at least one.</p>

<p>Fine Cut was developed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
	We were using PHP 5.3.6 for development.
</li>
<li>
	Apache HTTP Server 2.x version.<br />
	And, seems you could use another web server.<br />
	Just look inside .htaccess files of root dir
	and sub dirs to make same settings.
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>However, as for Apache, we need to use modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rewrite_module: strong dependency</strong></li>
<li>deflate_module: will work without, but with no gzip</li>
<li>env_module: will work without look in .htaccess</li>
<li>expires_module: will work without look in .htaccess</li>
<li>filter_module: will work without look in .htaccess</li>
<li>headers_module: will work withouts look in .htaccess</li>
<li>mime_module: will work without look in .htaccess</li>
<li>setenvif_module: will work without look in .htaccess</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<p>Yes, you don't need database engine to run Fine Cut.</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>To use Fine Cut &laquo;_adm&raquo; panel you'll need modern browser, for example: </p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 9+</li>
<li>Firefox 3.6+</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Opera 12 (or, may be older, we didn't make tests)</li>
<li>Safari</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>In common we could say: Latest WebKit or Gecko engine is fully supported.</p>
<br />

<p>And, yes, by default Admin Panel is always there: <br /></p>
<p><strong><nobr>http:// YourHost / YourInstallDir/_adm</nobr></strong></p>
<p>You could <a href="/documentation/installation/configure/">read</a> how to rename it.</p>
