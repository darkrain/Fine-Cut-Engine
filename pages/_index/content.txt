<p><strong>Proposal or preposition of Fine Cut is very simple &ndash; to create pages, but do it well enough for us: we wish be happy to create pages with it.</strong></p>
<p>We do like Unix way, one utility for one direction. Pages creation process must be very the simple, then we could tell our stories with the easies way.</p>

<p>And we don't like to manage compexity thing, we don't like to participate in: installation process, settings understanding or any work with database storage. Because each additional step is just tediousness.</p>

<p>From the other side, yes, we have a lot of advanced friends, who tald that we are stupid and narrow-minded. Therefore especially for them we decided to passthrough ability to engage in complicatedness, and it was done easy too.</p>

<p>One of the first step was UI. We do like JS, we do like JQuery, therefore our choice was obvious. And we do like bootstrap, and it is only template availiable after installation. So, everyone who would like our choice is able to investigate everything was made simple.</p>

<p>Finally, we wish to say &laquo;Good Luck!&raquo; to everyone.</p>

<p>PS: &laquo;Easy way &ndash; easy go&raquo;... take it easy, be happy ;^)</p>
