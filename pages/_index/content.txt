<p><strong>The proposal or preposition of Fine Cut is very simple &ndash; to create pages, but do it well enough for us: we wish be happy to create pages with it.</strong></p>
<p>We do like Unix way, one utility for one direction. Pages creation process must be very simple, then we could tell our stories with the easiest way.</p>

<p>And we don't like to manage complexity thing, we don't like to participate in: &laquo;installation process&raquo;, &laquo;settings understanding&raquo; or any &laquo;work with database storage&raquo;. Because each additional step is just tediousness.</p>

<p>From the other side, yes, we have a lot of advanced friends, who told that we are stupid and narrow-minded. Therefore especially for them we decided to passthrough ability to engage in complicatedness, and it was done easy too.</p>

<p>One of the first step was UI. We do like JS, we do like JQuery, and our choice was obvious. And we do like bootstrap, and it's CSS template is only availiable by default after &laquo;installation&raquo;. And, anyone who like our choice, be able to see that everything was simple..</p>

<p>Finally, we wish to say &laquo;Good Luck!&raquo; to everyone.</p>

<p>PS: &laquo;Easy way &ndash; easy go&raquo;... take it easy, be happy ;^)</p>
